# Map of islands and shallow water areas in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia) 
This repository contains data and code used to make a map of islands and shallow water areas for the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. The map was obtained using a two-stepped classification approach, described below, and simple statistics and graphs were then calculated in python.

## Two-stepped mapping approach
### Step 1: High-resolution imagery mapping
The starting point is a high-resolution multispectral (R,G,B,NIR) PLEIADES image acquired on 2020-03-26. The image was pan-sharpened using ArcMap and the panchromatic image accompanying the original dataset. 

IMAGE

This image was then classified with Trimble Ecognition Developer (ver.9.5.1) as follows:
1. The image was segmented using a "multiresolution segmentation", giving as weights for R,G,B = 1 and NIR = 2. The scale parameter of the segmentation was set to 200. The shape of the homogeneity criterion was set to 0.1 and its compactness was set to 0.5.
2. Six classes were defined: Built environment,Deep water,Shallow-water sand/reef complex,Beach sands,Shallow-water reef,Vegetation. These classes were used in a Nearest Neighbor classification. The results were exported as shapefile (smooting the edges with the built-in Ecognition export function).
