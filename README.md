# Map of islands and shallow water areas in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia) 
This repository contains data and code used to make a map of islands and shallow water areas for the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. The map was obtained using a two-stepped classification approach, described below, and simple statistics were then obtained in python.
